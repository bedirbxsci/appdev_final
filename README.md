# MiNotes

A study app for any subject.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up server

To run without backend, comment out backend functionalities and replace with mock data.
First, we can just take an image of your work, and the server would genearte questions for you to use to study and pass your exams. After that, you can also store your notes on the device locally, so you can study offline and come back to it whenever you want to.
